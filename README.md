## Class Meetings

Monday / Wednesday Friday at 1:35 PM to 2:40 PM. On most days we will
begin on-time and will use all of the class period.

**Note** my next class is clear on the other side of the building and I
don't amble to quickly. As a consequence, my ability to engage in
conversation after class is limited. My apologies in advance if I have
to cut you off.

## Syllabus

The Syllabus is [here](./Syllabus/syllabus.pdf).

## Installation guide

The installation guide is found [here](./install.md)

## My Assembly Language Book

My book is a work in progress. It is located
[here](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/asm_book).

You can earn 1 point of extra credit by finding typos in the book. Only
the first person to find an error gets the extra credit. Everyone else
gets my thanks!

## Useful Links

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#ARM_(A64)) link
is to Wikipedia explaining the ARM 64 Linux calling convention.
Understanding the calling convention is critical to programming in
assembly language.

Note that calling conventions are platform dependent. The ARM-based Mac,
for example, uses a different calling convention. Why? Because Apple.

More useful resources are located [here](./reference).
