## Class Meetings

Monday / Wednesday / Friday at 1:35 PM to 2:40 PM. We will begin on-time
and will usually but not always use all of the class period.

**Note my next class is clear on the other side of the building and I
don't amble to quickly. As a consequence, my ability to engage in
conversation after class is limited.**

**My apologies in advance if I have to cut you off.**

## Syllabus

The Syllabus is [here](./Syllabus/syllabus.pdf). Read it.

Note that attendance is a graded component of the course.

### Final Grades

These weightings are subject to change.

| Type | Weight | Comment |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
|Projects / Homework | 80% | Projects and any other forms of homework |
| Final | 10% | Multiple choice, cumulative |
| Attendance | 10% | See the actual syllabus |

## Use of Zoom / Office Hours

I do not post office hours even though doing so is a requirement of all
faculty. When a faculty member posts fixed office hours there is a
portion of the class which can *never* make them due to other
commitments.

What I do instead, which I believe is better, is have "open" office
hours. I.e. any time is a potential office hour. Simply use Google
Calendar to book an appointment with me. Remember to send me the
invitation!

As all help sessions are provided via Zoom, nights and weekends are OK
within reason. Mornings are difficult.

Wednesdays near noon hours are not possible due to campus obligations.

## Installation guide

Our programming environment is a Linux ARM distribution. It is required
on both Windows and Macintosh (even if you have an ARM-based Macintosh).
The installation guide is found [here](./install.md).

Note, if you are on an ARM Windows machine, let me know.

## My Assembly Language Book

My book is a work in progress. It is located
[here](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/asm_book).

You can earn 1 point of extra credit by finding typos in the book. Only
the first person to find an error gets the extra credit. Everyone else
gets my thanks and a mention in the book!

## Useful Links

[This link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#ARM_(A64))
is to Wikipedia explaining the ARM 64 Linux calling convention. We will
go over this in class and it is also covered in my book.

Understanding the calling convention is critical to programming in
assembly language.

Note that calling conventions are platform dependent.

More useful ARM  resources are located [here](./reference).

Here are more resources I have prepared for you:
