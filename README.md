## Class Meetings

Monday / Wednesday Friday at 1:35 PM to 2:40 PM. On most days we will
begin on-time and will use all of the class period.

**Note** my next class is clear on the other side of the building and I
don't amble to quickly. As a consequence, my ability to engage in
conversation after class is limited. My apologies in advance if I have
to cut you off.

## Syllabus

The Syllabus is [here](./Syllabus/syllabus.pdf). Read it.

## Installation guide

Our programming environment is a Linux ARM distribution. It is required
on both Windows and Macintosh (even if you have an ARM-based Macintosh).
The installation guide is found [here](./install.md)

## My Assembly Language Book

My book is a work in progress. It is located
[here](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/asm_book).

You can earn 1 point of extra credit by finding typos in the book. Only
the first person to find an error gets the extra credit. Everyone else
gets my thanks!

## Useful Links

[This link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#ARM_(A64))
is to Wikipedia explaining the ARM 64 Linux calling convention.
Understanding the calling convention is critical to programming in
assembly language.

Note that calling conventions are platform dependent. The ARM-based Mac,
for example, uses a different calling convention. Why? Because Apple.

More useful ARM  resources are located [here](./reference).

Here are more resources I have prepared for you:
