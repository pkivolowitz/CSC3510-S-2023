# getopt Tutorial

## getopt

**Use of getopt is required in this course.**

This project helps you learn to use getopt (command line arguments)
in your projects.

The explanations are found in the code.

## Sample Makefile

This directory contains a reasonable but tiny makefile.
Specifically, it understands `clean` and handling
dependencies.

**Because your projects will typically require more then
one program, you must supply me with working makefiles.**
